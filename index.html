        The band was formed in 2005 as an acappella group by Baraza, Chimano and
        Savara, who had met at the Upper Hill High School and performed in
        Voices in the Light, a music group at the school. They then met
        guitarist Otieno, who attended Strathmore School, at the Alliance
        française in Nairobi, where they would frequent and decided to form
        Sauti (Swahili for "sound") and immediately wrote their first song,
        "Mafunzo ya Dunia" (Literally: lessons of the world), which would later
        feature in their debut studio album Mwanzo. The band later added the
        Spanish word "Sol" (sun) to their name and formed Sauti Sol (supposed to
        mean "voices in the sun"). In 2006, the band participated in the
        Spotlight on Kenyan Music competition, hosted by the Alliance française
        in Nairobi. They were included in the album compilation recording and
        later got signed to Penya Records. The four members all completed their
        university education in Kenya. Baraza studied journalism at the United
        States International University, while Savara studied commerce and
        finance at Africa Nazarene University. Chimano studied journalism at the
        University of Nairobi, while Otieno studied actuarial science at the
        Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Sauti Sol
        released their debut studio album Mwanzo on 4 August 2009, via their
        record label Penya Records, to critical acclaim, and followed up with
        their second studio album Sol Filosofia two years later. The music video
        for the album's second single, "Coming Home", earned them the Best Music
        Video award at the 2011 Kisima Music Awards, with the group itself also
        winning the Best Fusion Artist/Group of the Year award...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauti_Sol">read more</a>
