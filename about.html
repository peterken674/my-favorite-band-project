          The band was formed in 2005 as an acappella group by Baraza, Chimano and
        Savara, who had met at the Upper Hill High School and performed in
        Voices in the Light, a music group at the school. They then met
        guitarist Otieno, who attended Strathmore School, at the Alliance
        française in Nairobi, where they would frequent and decided to form
        Sauti (Swahili for "sound") and immediately wrote their first song,
        "Mafunzo ya Dunia" (Literally: lessons of the world), which would later
        feature in their debut studio album Mwanzo.[4] The band later added the
        Spanish word "Sol" (sun) to their name and formed Sauti Sol (supposed to
        mean "voices in the sun").</p>
